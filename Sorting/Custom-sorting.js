//Write a function that sorts an array in a descending order. The exception is that if it encounters a prime number, it should erase it from the array.

//Note: this should be entirely from scratch no inbuilt sorting functions allowed.

//Note: no String function or processing is allowed. 
//Only use raw mathematical operations, loops and conditional statements.
